Currently, I am a post-doctoral research associate at the <a href = "https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS)</a> and <a href = "https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/applied-mathematics-plasma-physics/index.php" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Applied Math & Plasma Physics </a> group in Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA. I am also a part of the <a href = "https://lanl-ansi.github.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Advanced Network Science Initiative (ANSI) </a> working with <a href = "https://azlotnik.github.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Anatoly Zlotnik </a> and <a href = "https://kaarthiksundar.github.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Kaarthik Sundar </a>. I currently work on modeling and optimization of gas grid networks with a focus on integrating hydrogen and natural gas in existing pipeline networks. I am also interested in algorithms and applications for mathematical programing with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) which are used to solve variational inequalities in optimization.  

I obtained my PhD working with Prof. <a href = "http://numero.cheme.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> Lorenz Biegler </a> in Chemical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh in 2021. I did my Bachelors (with Honors) in Chemical Engineering (minor in Electrical Engineering) from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in India 2016.
